						<div class="card-body text-white">
						<h2 class="card-title">Tom</h2>
						<p class="card-text">Tom, named "Jasper" in his debut appearance, is a gray and white domestic short haired cat. 
							"Tom" is a generic name for a male cat. He is usually, but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable, or even pampered life. 
							Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry's wits.	
							Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry. 
							He tries to hurt or compete with him just to taunt Jerry, even as revenge, or to obtain a reward from a human, including his owner(s)/master(s), for catching Jerry, or for generally doing his job well as a house cat.

					<div class=" col-md-6">
						<div class="card-body text-white">
							<h2 class="card-title">Jerry</h2>
							<p class="card-text">Jerry, whose name is not explicitly mentioned in his debut appearance, is a small, brown house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom. 
								Jerry possesses surprising strength for his size, approximately the equivalent of Tom's, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts.
								They occasionally end up being friends, although there is often a last-minute event that ruins the truce. 
								Both characters display sadistic tendencies, in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other, although it is often in response to a triggering event.

			<!--Spike-->

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img src="https://picsum.photos/700/300?random=3" class="img-fluid rounded-start" alt="Image of Spike">
					</div>

					<div class=" col-md-6">
						<div class="card-body text-white">
							<h2 class="card-title">Spike</h2>
							<p class="card-text">In his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal with Spike, known as "Killer" and "Butch" in some shorts, an angry, vicious but gullible bulldog who tries to attack Tom for bothering him or his son Tyke. 
								Spike's coat has altered throughout the years between gray and creamy tan.
								Most cartoons with Spike in them conform to a theme: Spike is trying to accomplish something, such as building a dog house or sleeping, when Tom and Jerry's antics stop him. 
								Spike, usually blaming Tom, threatens him if it happens again. 
								Jerry overhears and deliberately causes trouble, forcing Tom to take the blame.

					</div>

					<div class=" col-md-6">
						<div class="card-body text-white">
							<h2 class="card-title">Tyke</h2>
							<p class="card-text">Tyke is described as a cute, sweet-looking, happy and lovable puppy. 
								He is Spike's son. Unlike Spike, Tyke does not speak and only communicates by barking, yapping, wagging his tail, whimpering and growling.
								Spike always goes out of his way to care for his son and make sure that he is safe from Tom. 
								Tyke loves his father and Spike loves his son; they get along like friends. 
								Most of the time they are shown taking a nap or Spike is teaching Tyke the main facts of life about being a dog.

			<!--Butch-->
			<div class="card mb-3 bg-primary col-12" >
				
				<div class="row g-0">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img src="https://picsum.photos/700/300?random=5" class="img-fluid rounded-start" alt="Image of Butch">
					</div>

					<div class=" col-md-6">
						<div class="card-body text-white">
							<h2 class="card-title">Butch</h2>
							<p class="card-text">Butch is a black, cigar-smoking alley cat who also wants to eat Jerry. 
								He is Tom's most frequent adversary and is usually seen rivaling Tom over Toodles Galore.
								Butch is often portrayed as the leader of Tom's alley cat buddies, which include Lightning, Topsy, and Meathead. 
								He talks more often than Tom or Jerry in most shorts.
								Butch was originally introduced in Hugh Harman's 1941 short The Alley Cat and was later integrated into the Tom and Jerry series.

			<!--Toodles Galore-->
			<div class="card mb-3 bg-primary col-12" >
				
				<div class="row g-0">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img src="https://picsum.photos/700/300?random=6" class="img-fluid rounded-start" alt="Image of Toodles Galore">
					</div>

					<div class=" col-md-6">
						<div class="card-body text-white">
							<h2 class="card-title">Toodles Galore</h2>
							<p class="card-text">Toodles Galore is the elegant, white female cat who is often the object of affection for both Tom and Butch. 
								She does not speak in the cartoons but plays a central role in the love-triangle dynamic between the two male cats.
								She was first introduced alongside Butch in The Alley Cat (1941) before being integrated into the Tom and Jerry series, where she appears mostly as Tom's love interest.

			<!--Nibbles-->
			<div class="card mb-3 bg-primary col-12" >
				
				<div class="row g-0">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img src="https://picsum.photos/700/300?random=7" class="img-fluid rounded-start" alt="Image of Nibbles">
					</div>

					<div class=" col-md-6">
						<div class="card-body text-white">
							<h2 class="card-title">Nibbles</h2>
							<p class="card-text">Nibbles is a small gray mouse who often appears in shorts as an orphan mouse. 
								He is a carefree individual who very rarely understands the danger of the situation, simply following instructions the best he can both to Jerry's command and his own innocent understanding of the situation. 
								This can lead to such results as "getting the cheese" by simply asking Tom to pick it up for him, rather than following Jerry's example of outmaneuvering and sneaking around Tom. 
								However, during a short in which he rescued Robin Hood, his voice was instead more masculine, gruff, and cockney accented.

			<!--The Housekeeper-->
			<div class="card mb-3 bg-primary col-12" >
				
				<div class="row g-0">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<img src="https://picsum.photos/700/300?random=8" class="img-fluid rounded-start" alt="Image of The Housekeeper">
					</div>

					<div class=" col-md-6">
						<div class="card-body text-white">
							<h2 class="card-title">The Housekeeper</h2>
							<p class="card-text">The housekeeper, often seen from the torso down, is a heavy-set, middle-aged black woman who frequently has to deal with the mayhem created by Tom and Jerry. 
								Voiced by character actress Lillian Randolph, she is often assumed to be the owner of Tom and possibly the homeowner as well.
								Her face was only briefly shown in Saturday Evening Puss. 
								The name "Mammy Two Shoes" was mistakenly attributed to the character in a 1975 article and has since become widely associated with her, though it was never used in any Tom and Jerry cartoon.
